FINDING BRIDGE interface
# First, find which network your container is connected to
docker inspect api-gateway | grep NetworkMode

# Now list all network interfaces to find the bridge
ip link show | grep "br-"

# To confirm this is the right bridge, inspect the Docker network
docker network inspect petclinic_default
# Look at the "Id" field - the first 12 characters should match your bridge interface
